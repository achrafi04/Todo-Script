# Simple Task Manager

## What's This?

Hey there! This is a basic task manager that we've built using Bash. It's pretty straightforward and lets you add, update, delete, mark, and search tasks. All of this is done through a user-friendly text menu.

## How We Built It

### Storing Tasks
- **Where?**: We keep all the tasks in a simple text file named `todo.txt`.
- **How?**: Each task gets its own line in the file, and we store it like this: `id|title|description|due_date|completed`.
  - `id`: A number for the task.
  - `title`: A brief summary of the task.
  - `description`: More details about the task.
  - `due_date`: When the task needs to be done by, in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
  - `completed`: This is either `Y` (yes) or `N` (no), depending on whether the task is done.

### Organizing the Code
We've split the script into several functions, each one handling a different part of managing tasks:

- `display_menu()`: Shows the main menu.
- `add_task()`: Lets you add a new task.
- `display_tasks()`: Shows all the tasks.
- `update_task()`: Lets you change a task.
- `delete_task()`: Removes a task.
- `mark_task_completed()`: Marks a task as done.
- `show_task_info()`: Gives more info about a task.
- `list_tasks_by_day()`: Shows tasks for a certain day.
- `search_task_by_title()`: Finds tasks by their title.

The `main()` function is where everything starts. It keeps showing the menu and running the right function based on what you choose.

## How to Use It

### 1. Save the Script
First, copy the script into a file. You could name it `todo.sh`, for example. Don't forget to put `#!/bin/bash` at the top of the file.

### 2. Make the Script Executable
Open up a terminal and go to the directory where `todo.sh` is. Then, run this command to make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x todo.sh
```

### 3. Run the Script
In the terminal, you can run the script like this:

```bash
./todo.sh
```

### 4. Use the Menu
You'll see a menu with options for creating, updating, deleting, and managing tasks. Just type the number for what you want to do (like `1` to create a new task).

## What Each Operation Does

### 1. Add Task
- Asks you for the task title, description, due date, and whether it's completed.
- Checks the title and due date to make sure they're okay.
- Makes a new task ID based on how many lines are in `todo.txt`.
- Adds the new task to `todo.txt`.

### 2. Display Tasks
- Checks if `todo.txt` is there.
- Uses `awk` to format and show each task in `todo.txt`.

### 3. Update Task
- Asks you for the task ID to update.
- If the task is there, it shows the current task details.
- Lets you pick which field to update (title, description, due date, or whether it's completed).
- Checks the new input and updates the task using `sed`.

### 4. Delete Task
- Asks you for the task ID to delete.
- If the task is there, it removes the line for the task ID using `sed`.

### 5. Mark Task Completed
- Asks you for the task ID to mark as completed.
- If the task is there, it changes the completion status to `Y` using `sed`.

### 6. Show Task Info
- Asks you for the task ID to show.
- If the task is there, it shows the task details using `grep` and `cut`.

### 7. List Tasks by Day
- Asks you for a specific date.
- Shows tasks that are done and not done for that date using `grep` and `awk`.

### 8. Search Task by Title
- Asks you for a title to search for.
- Shows tasks with titles that match what you searched for using `grep` and `awk`.

## Example Usage

### Add a Task
- Pick `1` from the menu.
- Type in the task title, description, due date, and whether it's completed.
- The task gets added to `todo.txt` and gets a unique ID.

### Display All Tasks
- Pick `2` from the menu.
- All the tasks get listed with their details.

### Update a Task
- Pick `3` from the menu.
- Type in the ID of the task you want to update.
- Pick the field to update and type in the new value.
- The task gets updated in `todo.txt`.

### Delete a Task
- Pick `4` from the menu.
- Type in the ID of the task you want to delete.
- The task gets removed from `todo.txt`.
